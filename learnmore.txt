No 1 option is .bat file called runprogram.bat 
it will execute execute.bat that run mainapp.php through google chrome
i have created full OOP.php (mainapp.php) 
under public folder in subfolder called php
This file can check if my database is available and table is available too; in
case they are available it will run localhost:8000 as default server of laravel server
if they are not available it will create it by default.then rediret to localhost:8000
